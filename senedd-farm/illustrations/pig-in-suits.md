A satirical painting of the Senedd building in Cardiff, showing a wider angle with pigs in suits standing in front of it. The pigs, dressed in formal suits and ties, are depicted as authoritative and smug, symbolizing political power and corruption. The wider view captures more of the modern architecture of the Senedd building, with its distinctive glass structure and surroundings. The contrast between the serious-looking pigs and the grandeur of the Senedd creates a humorous yet critical portrayal. The color palette features muted tones for the building, with the pigs standing out in their darker attire.
