A powerful painting of Sian Reardon, a steel magnate, standing defiantly in front of her steelworks. She is holding a piece of finely crafted steel in one hand, symbolizing the high quality of her product. Her posture is strong and defiant, challenging the constant pressure to reduce emissions. Behind her, towering smokestacks release thick clouds of smoke, representing the industrial might of her steel production. On one side of the painting, dark clouds and smoke dominate the sky, symbolizing the environmental pressure she faces. On the other side, light breaks through, highlighting the gleaming steel she produces, showing the importance of her industry to Europe. Sianâ€™s expression is bold and determined, reflecting her resilience in the face of adversity.
