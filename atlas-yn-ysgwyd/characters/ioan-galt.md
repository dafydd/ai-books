A detailed and dramatic painting of Iwan, a brilliant Welsh engineer and inventor, standing in the foreground, looking out over the hidden retreat of Cwm Galt in the Brecon Beacons. The scene shows a secluded, high-tech community nestled deep in the mountains, hidden from the outside world. The background features rugged, mountainous terrain with towering peaks, while the valley below is dotted with advanced buildings and workshops, symbolizing the creativity and innovation of Wales' brightest minds. Iwan is shown with a thoughtful, determined expression, his hands resting on plans or blueprints. The lighting is soft, with beams of sunlight breaking through the clouds, illuminating the hidden valley. The painting includes a quotation 'Pwy yw Ioan Galt?' in bold, dramatic script. The overall tone is one of hope, innovation, and escape from oppressive government control.
