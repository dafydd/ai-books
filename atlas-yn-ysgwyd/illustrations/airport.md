A detailed painting of a crumbling airport with no visitors, capturing the sense of decay and abandonment. The airport entrance is in a state of disrepair, with cracks in the pavement, overgrown vegetation, and broken windows. A faded Welsh flag hangs over the entrance, fluttering weakly in the wind. The scene is empty and desolate, with a few rusting airplanes visible in the background and a cloudy, overcast sky adding to the melancholic mood. The overall tone is somber, symbolizing the collapse of a once-bustling hub.
