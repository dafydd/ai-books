`Atlas shrugged set in wales and in Welsh`

Here’s a Welsh-themed reimagining of *Atlas Shrugged*:

### Title: *Atlas yn Ysgwyd: Cymru'n Cau*
(*Atlas Shrugged: Wales Shuts Down*)

The story unfolds in a near-future version of Wales, where once-thriving industries like steel, coal, and technology are crumbling under the weight of government interference, heavy taxation, and unsustainable policies aimed at achieving lofty social goals.

### Themes:
- **Industrial Collapse**: Wales’ major industries—steelworks, mining, energy—are nationalized and mismanaged. Bureaucracy prevents innovation, and businesses are stifled.
- **Entrepreneurial Resistance**: The few remaining industrialists and innovators are demonized by a government more concerned with wealth redistribution and regulation than economic freedom.
- **Nationalism and Culture**: Welsh identity and the push for independence play a central role, with the government justifying their policies as “protecting the people,” but ultimately alienating the very individuals who drive innovation and growth.

### Setting:
- **Port Talbot**: The steelworks are depicted as a symbolic battleground between industry and government, gradually decaying as it’s over-regulated.
- **Snowdonia and the Valleys**: The landscape serves as both a reminder of Wales' natural beauty and its potential for greatness—if only it were free from the government's stranglehold on innovation.
- **A Hidden Community (Galt’s Gulch equivalent)**: Deep in the Welsh mountains, some of the best minds and entrepreneurs retreat, forming a secret society that refuses to prop up a government that exploits their talent without rewarding it.

### Characters:
- **Dafydd Taggart**: The Welsh version of Dagny Taggart, he runs a rail company and tries to keep industry moving while government regulations increase. 
- **Iwan Galt**: The John Galt of Wales, an inventor from a tech startup who goes underground, taking the best minds of the country with him.
- **Gwenllian Jones**: A politician akin to James Taggart, who benefits from cronyism and inefficiency.
  
The novel follows their struggles as Wales descends into chaos, eventually leading to the collapse of the state-run industries and the emergence of a new, free society.

### Sample Welsh Excerpt:
*“Pam y mae’r rhai sy’n adeiladu ein dyfodol yn cael eu cosbi? Pam mae Cymru’n cau, tra bo’r rhai a chanddynt weledigaeth yn diflannu o’n golwg? Rydym yn sownd, ar wyntoedd oer y dyffrynnoedd, yn disgwyl i rywun arall ein harbed.”*

`I want much more`

Here’s a much more detailed imagining of *Atlas Shrugged* set in Wales, with a focus on the Welsh cultural, political, and economic landscape. Let’s dive deeper into the plot, characters, themes, and key elements of this Welsh version.

### Title: *Atlas yn Ysgwyd: Cymru'n Cau* (*Atlas Shrugged: Wales Shuts Down*)

### Overview:
Set in a future Wales where the government has seized control of every major industry, *Atlas yn Ysgwyd* tells the story of a nation crippled by over-regulation and cronyism. Once the pride of Europe for its advanced engineering, rich natural resources, and thriving innovation, Wales has become a bureaucratic quagmire. The plot follows a small group of industrialists and innovators who resist the government's attempts to control their work, culminating in a philosophical battle between individualism and collectivism.

---

### Characters:
#### 1. **Dafydd Taggart** (*Dagny Taggart*):
Dafydd is the managing director of *Rheilffyrdd Cymru*, a rail company responsible for the remaining rail infrastructure that keeps Wales’ economy from collapsing entirely. He’s fiercely independent, pragmatic, and deeply frustrated by the government’s endless regulations. While trying to modernize the aging railways, Dafydd faces resistance from political leaders and union officials who prioritize power over progress. 

#### 2. **Iwan Galt** (*John Galt*):
Iwan is a brilliant Welsh engineer and inventor, originally working in green energy. He disappears early in the novel, disillusioned by the oppressive policies of the Welsh government, which strip innovators of their rewards in favor of endless taxation and regulation. Unknown to most, Iwan secretly establishes *Cwm Galt*, a hidden retreat deep in the Brecon Beacons where Wales' brightest minds, from engineers to entrepreneurs, retreat to rebuild their society in secret, away from government interference.

#### 3. **Siân Reardon** (*Hank Rearden*):
Siân owns and runs *Dur Cymru*, the last steelworks in Port Talbot still operating at a fraction of its former glory. Siân is a fierce industrialist who has perfected a new type of durable steel alloy that could revolutionize Wales' infrastructure. However, she is constantly under attack by the government’s “green agenda” policies and forced to supply her steel at government-set prices. Her company teeters on the brink of bankruptcy, despite having the best product on the market.

#### 4. **Gwenllian Jones** (*James Taggart*):
Gwenllian is a self-serving politician who heads the Welsh Economic Council. She is obsessed with creating a utopia of "fairness" and "equality" through regulation and wealth redistribution. Under her leadership, key industries are nationalized, and massive public works programs (funded by unsustainable borrowing) are created, but all lead to inefficiency and eventual collapse. Gwenllian ignores the real crisis, blaming industry leaders for being greedy while praising the failing government policies.

#### 5. **Owain Pritchard** (*Francisco d'Anconia*):
Owain is a former mining magnate who is outwardly supporting the government’s new energy policies, including the closure of coal mines and the focus on wind and solar energy. Secretly, Owain is sabotaging the policies from within, knowing they will lead to disaster. He delivers some of the most scathing critiques of the Welsh government and its mismanagement of the country’s resources, mocking their obsession with surface-level environmentalism while ignoring Wales' true potential.

---

### Setting:
#### 1. **Port Talbot Steelworks:**

![](port-talbot-decline.webp)
Once the industrial heart of Wales, Port Talbot has become a battleground between Siân Reardon and the government. The steelworks is under constant pressure to reduce emissions, despite producing the finest steel in Europe. Port Talbot becomes a symbol of resistance against the overwhelming pressure to conform to unrealistic government mandates.

#### 2. **Cardiff:**
![The Senedd in Cardiff in a state of decline and disrepair](ruined-grand-senedd-cardiff.webp)
As the political hub, Cardiff is where Gwenllian Jones and her bureaucrats pass endless laws that choke innovation. The Welsh Senedd (parliament) is portrayed as out of touch with the realities faced by business owners and workers. The city is full of grand government buildings, but the infrastructure is crumbling, and services are failing.

#### 3. **Snowdonia / Brecon Beacons (Cwm Galt):**

![](cwm-galt-eryri.webp)
This hidden valley deep in the Welsh mountains is where Iwan Galt gathers the most brilliant minds of Wales. The valley is a utopia for innovators, free from government interference, where new inventions and businesses thrive. Here, the brightest minds of Wales live in secret, developing technologies that could save the country if only they were allowed to operate freely.

---

### Themes:
#### 1. **Industrial Decline:**
Wales' historic industries—coal, steel, and rail—are crumbling under the weight of government mandates. The government’s focus on sustainability and environmental protection has led to overregulation, killing the very industries that once powered the nation. The Welsh economy is on the verge of collapse, and the government continues to double down on failed policies.

#### 2. **Energy Crisis:**
Wales has transitioned to wind and solar energy under pressure from international environmental agreements. However, the country faces regular blackouts, and its dependence on unreliable renewable sources cripples the economy. This leads to widespread protests, but the government blames energy companies for "mismanagement" and nationalizes them.

#### 3. **Collectivism vs. Individualism:**
At the heart of the novel is the struggle between the government’s collectivist policies, which aim to ensure "fairness" by restricting wealth creation, and the individualism of Wales' remaining entrepreneurs, who see their innovations and profits seized in the name of equality.

#### 4. **Welsh Identity:**
Welsh nationalism and cultural identity play a significant role. The government’s policies are justified in the name of “preserving Welsh heritage,” but many characters see this as hypocritical, as the true ingenuity and spirit of the Welsh people are being stifled by bureaucratic control. There's an undercurrent of tension between preserving culture and embracing modernity.

---

### Plot:
#### Act 1: *The Collapse Begins*
The novel opens with Dafydd Taggart struggling to keep *Rheilffyrdd Cymru* running as rail infrastructure collapses due to government regulations. He confronts Gwenllian Jones, but she dismisses his concerns, claiming that nationalization and environmental policies are the future. Meanwhile, Siân Reardon fights to keep *Dur Cymru* alive, but her steel is priced out of the market due to endless government taxes and emissions mandates.

#### Act 2: *The Resistance Forms*
Iwan Galt disappears, leaving the industrial world in disarray. Over the course of the novel, Dafydd and Siân start to notice that the brightest minds in Wales are vanishing, and no one can explain why. Owain Pritchard begins to subtly sabotage government policies while publicly supporting them, knowing they will lead to disaster. 

#### Act 3: *Wales Shuts Down*
The energy crisis worsens, with blackouts becoming a daily occurrence. The Welsh government, desperate to maintain control, nationalizes the remaining industries, but this only accelerates the decline. Public anger grows, but the government blames external forces—foreign influence, "greedy capitalists"—for the collapse. 

#### Act 4: *Cwm Galt Revealed*
Dafydd and Siân discover Cwm Galt, where Iwan Galt and other brilliant minds are building a new society, free from government interference. They realize that the only way to save Wales is to let it collapse, allowing the people to see the failure of collectivism and embrace the power of individual achievement.

#### Act 5: *The Final Collapse*
Wales descends into chaos as the government can no longer provide basic services. Industries shut down, and infrastructure crumbles. In the final act, Iwan Galt delivers a broadcast to the people of Wales, explaining why he and others have withdrawn their talents from society. He challenges the people to reject the government’s false promises and rebuild from the ashes.

---

### Style:
- **Language**: The Welsh translation would incorporate idiomatic phrases and linguistic nuances unique to the language, emphasizing the cultural depth of the narrative. 
- **Tone**: The tone of the novel is serious and philosophical, with characters delivering powerful monologues about the nature of freedom, responsibility, and government overreach.

---

### Conclusion:
*Atlas yn Ysgwyd* is a philosophical and political novel about the limits of government control, the importance of individual liberty, and the danger of sacrificing innovation for the sake of equality. By setting the novel in Wales, it taps into the country’s rich industrial history and its modern political struggles, creating a compelling narrative about the price of progress.

`Yes please`

Great! Let's dive even deeper into some of the key elements of this Welsh reimagining of *Atlas Shrugged*. I'll start with the characters, key events, and philosophical dialogues, with a focus on how they tie into the specific cultural, industrial, and political contexts of Wales.

---

### **Key Characters (Expanded)**

#### **Dafydd Taggart** (Dagny Taggart)
Dafydd is a relentless entrepreneur who has spent his life building and modernizing *Rheilffyrdd Cymru* (Welsh Railways). He's deeply invested in seeing Wales prosper through infrastructure and innovation. His central conflict is his loyalty to his business and country, while the government’s interventions gradually destroy everything he has worked for.

- **Key Scene: Confrontation with Gwenllian Jones**  
Dafydd meets Gwenllian in Cardiff to plead for more private control over the failing rail network. The scene is a heated argument in the Senedd (Welsh Parliament), where Dafydd lists the failures of public ownership: frequent delays, infrastructure collapse, and disorganized state-run projects. Gwenllian, cool and detached, insists that nationalization is the only way to ensure "equality and fairness" for the Welsh people. Dafydd’s frustration boils over as he realizes that her vision of fairness comes at the cost of efficiency, progress, and success.

- **Philosophical Dialogue: Individualism vs. Collectivism**  
Dafydd's central belief is that individual effort and innovation drive progress. He often reflects on how *Rheilffyrdd Cymru* flourished before government interference. His inner monologues, which echo John Galt's speeches, argue that the pursuit of personal success leads to the betterment of society as a whole.

---

#### **Iwan Galt** (John Galt)
Iwan Galt represents the intellectual and moral heart of the novel. A former energy engineer who pioneered Wales' green energy sector, Iwan grows disillusioned with the government’s heavy-handed approach to energy policies. His defection to *Cwm Galt* symbolizes the withdrawal of the mind from a society that punishes success.

- **Key Scene: The Creation of Cwm Galt**  
Set deep in Snowdonia, *Cwm Galt* is a hidden valley where the brightest minds of Wales—engineers, inventors, industrialists—have retreated. In this scene, Iwan invites Siân Reardon and Dafydd Taggart to see the community he has built. It’s a high-tech utopia, powered by renewable energy and advanced technologies. The landscape contrasts sharply with the decaying towns and cities under state control.

- **Philosophical Dialogue: "Who is Iwan Galt?"**  
In this version, "Who is Iwan Galt?" becomes a whispered question across Wales, symbolizing the disappearance of Wales’ most talented minds. The phrase takes on a philosophical meaning: “What happens when those who create refuse to be enslaved by those who consume?”

---

#### **Siân Reardon** (Hank Rearden)
Siân, the owner of *Dur Cymru*, represents the last bastion of Welsh industrial might. Her steelworks in Port Talbot struggle under crippling emissions regulations, but she remains determined to keep her business running. Siân is a hard-nosed realist, deeply proud of her work and her contributions to Welsh society, but growing increasingly frustrated by the government's refusal to recognize the value of industry.

- **Key Scene: Rearden Steel Under Siege**  
In this climactic scene, Siân faces a shutdown order from the Welsh Environmental Authority. The shutdown is framed as a victory for sustainability, but Siân knows it will cripple the steel industry. As her workers strike in protest of unpaid wages (a direct result of government price controls), Siân makes a final stand, refusing to close the plant. She delivers a powerful speech about the importance of industry, labor, and the human spirit.

- **Philosophical Dialogue: The Cost of Progress**  
Siân often reflects on the paradox of being punished for her success. In one key moment, she argues that true environmentalism and progress can only be achieved through innovation, not by strangling industry with unrealistic mandates. Her reflections are a counterpoint to Gwenllian’s simplistic view of sustainability.

---

#### **Owain Pritchard** (Francisco d'Anconia)
Owain plays the role of the charming, cynical former industrialist who has become a saboteur. Publicly, Owain supports the government’s energy policies, particularly the shift to wind and solar, while secretly orchestrating the collapse of government-led initiatives.

- **Key Scene: The Sabotage of the National Energy Grid**  
Owain Pritchard engineers a major blackout, crippling the national grid during a government speech on energy independence. As the lights go out in Cardiff, chaos ensues. Owain’s face is shown on the screen, laughing as he delivers a mocking critique of the government's reliance on unreliable energy sources, stating: *"The wind may blow, but not when you command it."*

- **Philosophical Dialogue: The Nature of Wealth and Power**  
Owain’s philosophy is rooted in the belief that wealth comes from the ability to create and produce, not from controlling or redistributing it. In private conversations with Dafydd and Siân, he reveals his disgust at how the government has turned the concept of wealth into something shameful, while secretly benefiting from it.

---

### **Key Events (Expanded)**

#### **The Collapse of Welsh Rail**
Wales’ rail infrastructure, once the backbone of its economy, is a central element of the story. As Dafydd struggles to modernize *Rheilffyrdd Cymru*, the government imposes endless restrictions, forcing the railways into ruin.

![](cardiff-train-station-in-decline.webp)
- **Event: Nationalization of Rail**
A major turning point in the novel is the nationalization of the rail industry. Gwenllian Jones celebrates this as a triumph for "the people," while Dafydd watches helplessly as services degrade further. Trains run late or not at all, and industrial towns that relied on rail transport are cut off, leading to mass unemployment and unrest.

#### **Energy Blackouts Across Wales**
The energy crisis becomes a pivotal plot element, highlighting the failure of the government’s green energy policies. Frequent blackouts plunge cities into darkness, with factories grinding to a halt and hospitals struggling to provide basic care.

- **Event: The Winter Blackout**
One of the most dramatic moments in the book is the *Gaeaf Du* ("Black Winter"), when the national grid fails during a particularly harsh winter. People freeze in their homes, unable to heat their houses or cook food. The Welsh government blames private energy companies for the crisis, even though the national grid has been under state control for years.

#### **Cwm Galt Revealed**
After much speculation, the location of *Cwm Galt* is revealed in a tense scene where Dafydd and Siân are led through the mountains of Snowdonia. This hidden community is self-sustaining, powered by Iwan’s inventions. 

- **Event: The Rebirth of Innovation**
At *Cwm Galt*, the entrepreneurs and inventors who have fled the failing state are free to innovate without restriction. In this scene, Iwan unveils a new type of renewable energy technology, far more efficient than anything the government has been able to produce. This moment contrasts starkly with the failing infrastructure of government-run Wales.

---

### **Philosophical Themes (Expanded)**

#### 1. **The Role of Government and Regulation**
The novel critiques the overreach of government into private industry, showing how regulation stifles creativity, productivity, and ultimately leads to societal collapse. The Welsh government's obsession with environmental targets, nationalization, and control over private businesses results in disaster.

- **Monologue Example**:  
In one of Dafydd’s speeches, he reflects on the irony of a government that claims to represent the people but punishes those who produce. He describes the slow decay of industry in Wales, comparing it to "a tree that has been strangled by its own vines."

#### 2. **Environmentalism vs. Industrial Progress**
While *Atlas yn Ysgwyd* doesn’t reject environmentalism outright, it critiques the government’s superficial and hypocritical approach to sustainability. The government prioritizes “green” policies that fail to account for real-world needs, such as energy security and industrial efficiency.

- **Siân Reardon’s Argument**:  
Siân makes the case that environmental progress and industrial growth are not mutually exclusive. She argues that innovation in industries like steel production could lead to greener practices, but only if the government stops punishing success.

#### 3. **Welsh National Identity**
The novel ties the question of individualism and collectivism into the context of Welsh national identity. The government claims to act in the name of Welsh heritage, but in doing so, it betrays the very spirit of ingenuity and hard work that defines Welsh history.

- **Monologue Example**:  
In a powerful speech, Iwan Galt addresses the people of Wales, asking: *"Is this the Wales our ancestors fought for? A land where those who build are punished? Where the brightest minds are forced into silence?"* He argues that true Welsh pride comes from the freedom to create, not from government-mandated equality.

---

### Conclusion
*Atlas yn Ysgwyd* is a sweeping epic of industrial decay, government overreach, and the fight for individual freedom, set against the uniquely Welsh backdrop of historic industries and rugged landscapes. It combines the philosophical weight of Ayn Rand's original with the cultural and political nuances of modern Wales.

`I want the scene where John galt interrupts the broadcast`

Absolutely! Let’s reimagine the iconic scene where John Galt interrupts the government broadcast, but now set in Wales, with Iwan Galt delivering a passionate speech that challenges the entire nation’s perception of governance, individualism, and freedom. Here’s how I’d envision this moment unfolding in *Atlas yn Ysgwyd*:

---

### **Scene: Iwan Galt Interrupts the Broadcast**

#### Setting:
It is a cold, grey evening in Cardiff. The government is hosting a nationally televised address, celebrating the “success” of its collectivist policies—despite widespread blackouts, industrial collapse, and public unrest. In the Senedd, Gwenllian Jones stands at the podium, delivering a speech praising the government’s recent nationalization efforts and promising the people of Wales that brighter days lie ahead.

Behind her, a massive screen broadcasts her speech live across Wales—from small homes in the Valleys to public squares in Cardiff. Families huddle in the cold, watching with resentment, as their power flickers.

The camera pans across the landscape of a nation in crisis: factories with smokeless chimneys, darkened cities, and broken railway lines. As Gwenllian speaks, her voice is full of false hope, but the people watching know better.

Suddenly, the screen flickers, the broadcast stutters, and her voice fades away.

The image of Gwenllian cuts out, replaced by static. Confusion spreads across the audience as murmurs rise. But then, out of the static, a calm, determined voice emerges.

---

#### **Iwan Galt Appears:**
On every screen in Wales, a new figure appears: Iwan Galt, standing in the shadow of the Snowdonia mountains. His face is stern but not angry, illuminated by the dying light of day. His presence is commanding, and his voice is steady.

**Iwan Galt:**  
*“People of Wales, the time has come to hear the truth.”*

The broadcast switches from Gwenllian’s polished propaganda to the rugged reality of Wales’ decay. Images of abandoned factories, empty coal mines, and derelict railways fill the screen.

**Iwan Galt:**  
*“For years, you have been told that your sacrifice is necessary for the good of all—that the collapse of our industries, the failure of our energy, and the decline of our livelihoods are justified in the name of equality, sustainability, and fairness.”*

His voice sharpens as the camera zooms in on his face.

**Iwan Galt:**  
*“But I ask you now: Has this made you free? Have these promises delivered the Wales you were told you deserved?”*

The crowd watching in Cardiff falls silent. In homes across the country, people lean in closer to their screens, feeling a strange, unfamiliar sense of hope.

The camera cuts back to Iwan, standing strong amidst the rugged Welsh landscape.

---

#### **Iwan Galt’s Speech:**
**Iwan Galt:**  
*“You’ve been told that those who build, who create, who lead—those who dare to achieve—are the cause of your suffering. You’ve been told that wealth is a sin, that ambition must be punished, that innovation must be controlled. But it is not the creators who have failed you—it is those who take from them, who burden them with laws and restrictions, and who suffocate the very spirit that drives progress.”*

The screen shows factories in Port Talbot lying idle, their furnaces cold and empty. Siân Reardon watches from her steelworks, her eyes filled with both frustration and admiration for the words being spoken.

**Iwan Galt:**  
*“I and those like me have refused to comply. We refuse to accept a system that demands everything of us and gives us nothing in return. We have retreated from this society, taking with us our knowledge, our inventions, our dreams. And now we stand here, free—while Wales crumbles under the weight of its own failures.”*

---

#### **The Challenge:**
The camera cuts to Gwenllian Jones and other politicians in the Senedd, shocked and furious, their broadcast interrupted. Their expressions turn to panic as they realize they are powerless to stop the broadcast.

**Iwan Galt (continuing):**  
*“Who has truly betrayed you, people of Wales? Is it those who would build a future—or those who would tear it down in the name of equality? Is it those who seek to create—or those who demand that all must suffer equally in the name of fairness?”*

Galt’s voice softens, taking on a tone of both sorrow and resolve.

**Iwan Galt:**  
*“I ask you to look around. What has your government given you, besides empty promises and failing infrastructure? Look at your railways, your steelworks, your energy grid. Look at the homes darkened by blackouts, the factories shuttered by laws written by those who have never built anything in their lives.”*

---

#### **The Call to Action:**
Iwan pauses, letting his words sink in. He looks directly into the camera, his eyes piercing, his tone firm.

**Iwan Galt:**  
*“To those who still believe in the power of creation, in the right to succeed, in the dignity of hard work—I say this: We are waiting for you. We have built a new Wales, far from the reach of those who would destroy it. Here, in the valleys and mountains, the fires of industry and innovation still burn. We have not abandoned you—your government has.”*

The broadcast shows brief flashes of *Cwm Galt*, the hidden valley where Wales’ greatest minds have retreated to. Advanced technologies, thriving businesses, and a community built on cooperation and freedom.

**Iwan Galt:**  
*“Join us. Leave behind the system that enslaves you. Leave behind the laws that punish you for daring to succeed. We are building a new future, and we will not wait for those who seek to drag us down.”*

---

#### **The Final Words:**
Galt’s voice deepens, carrying the weight of his final message.

**Iwan Galt:**  
*“I will not return to a world that denies my right to create. I will not live in a society that destroys those who make it possible. If you wish to live as free men and women, follow me. If not—then continue to live in the darkness you have chosen.”*

The camera zooms out as Iwan Galt turns and walks away, disappearing into the misty landscape of Snowdonia. The broadcast cuts out, leaving only static on the screens across Wales.

---

#### Aftermath:
In the Senedd, Gwenllian Jones is left speechless. The government scrambles to regain control of the narrative, but the damage is done. People across Wales have heard the truth, and the seeds of rebellion have been planted.

---

### Analysis of the Scene:
This scene is pivotal, just as it is in the original *Atlas Shrugged*. Iwan Galt’s interruption isn’t just a speech—it’s a rallying cry for those who have been suffocated by government control. By directly confronting the failures of the Welsh government, Galt’s words resonate with the populace, challenging them to reconsider their acceptance of the status quo.

- **Visual Imagery**: The contrast between the decaying, industrialized Wales and the thriving community of *Cwm Galt* serves as a powerful visual metaphor for what Wales could be without the weight of collectivism.
- **Philosophical Message**: Galt’s speech reinforces the core Randian philosophy that individualism and creativity are the driving forces of progress, while collectivism leads only to decay and stagnation.
